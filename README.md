## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open (http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Routes

### Registration
To register a new user, navigate to:\
(http://localhost:3000/add-new-user)

### User List
To view the user list, update user information, or delete a user, navigate to:\
(http://localhost:3000/users)

## Backend Service

This project also includes a backend service that runs on port 3001. The backend handles the registration functionality.

### Base URL

The base URL for the backend service is: `http://localhost:3001/api/registration`

Make sure the backend service is running to ensure the app functions correctly. The backend is required for handling registration and other API requests.

To start the backend service, navigate to the backend directory and run:

### `npm start`

This will start the backend server on (http://localhost:3001).

Ensure that both the frontend and backend services are running simultaneously for the full application to work as expected.

## Database Configuration

The database configuration is set up in the `.env` file. You will need to update the `.env` file with your own database credentials.
